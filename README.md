# Bot Fighter
## This page servers as documentation for Bryce Olivier's final project for LSU CSC 2463, Bot Fighter.

This project is a culmination of programming art and sound while incorporating physical computing along with it. The project is a simple, two-player fighting game, where one player uses the keyboard and the other uses an arduino that functions as a controller. Winning the game means the oponent has reached zero health, which is visible via health bars at the top of the screen, and can be done by punching the oponent to deplete their health or by knocking them off the side of the screen. Inspiration was taken from classic fighter games, such as Street Fighter and Super Smash Bros. All sound and music was made by me, as well as the Arduino controller.
